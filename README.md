# speech-recognition
Speech recognition is the ability of computers and devices to understand and interpret spoken language. It does this by using algorithms and applying machine learning techniques that translate audio input into text for the purpose of having a voice communication with systems.  Such applications range from virtual assistants, transcription services, hands-free devices, and accessibility tools to enhance user experience by making it easier to communicate naturally and intuitively with technology.
